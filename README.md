## Hi there

They call me enjarai, old name with no meaning really, it just kinda stuck. My main occupation currently is making silly and/or goofy Minecraft mods using only mildly cursed coding standards. You should check out some of my stuff in the pinned repos! Besides that, I also enjoy watching anime and reading a wide variety of highly intellectual literature, including western fantasy and eastern light/web novels.

The best way to contact me is definitely via discord, either join [my server](https://discord.gg/WcYsDDQtyR), or message me directly @enjarai#3333.

For more information and a nice overview of my projects, visit [my website](https://enjarai.nl/).
